<h1>What Is Our Vision?</h1>
	<p>
	All for one and one for all.  That is the creed which binds the Six Pilgrims, fostering a core of committed Christians not content to become 
	churchgoers only when a Sunday service is being held in their own parish but to become church-followers prepared to travel on other Sundays
	to support whichever of their fellow churches is bearing witness.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Benefice of the Six Pilgrims is part of the Bruton and Cary Deanery of 45 parishes in the south-east corner of the Diocese of Bath & Wells,
	centred on the beautiful medieval city of Wells, the smallest city in England.
	</p>
	<p>
	Each of our six parishes is responsible for its own management and finances, with  churchwardens and PCCs to run services and to identify
	and support pastoral care.  The fabric of all six churches is well maintained and receive favourable Quinquennial Reports.
	</p>
	<p>
	 The churchwardens of the individual parishes come together on a quarterly basis to form the Six Pilgrims Committee
	 which provides overall management in administrating the Diocesan common share that is allocated to the Benefice as a whole.
	</p>
	<p>
	The annual figure is split into seven amounts. Six for payments by the parishes, with the level adjusted to reflect the 
	size of the population. The seventh share is allocated to the Six Pilgrims account which is responsible for central 
	expenses and the cost of producing the Six Pilgrims Magazine that is distributed free of charge to all 450 households each month.
	</p>
	<p>
	Revenue for individual churches stems from plate gifts of the congregation and specific parish giving (much of it Gift Aid) 
	with the results of their own fund-raising activities augmented by a share of the proceeds of major events jointly staged by all six churches.
	</p>
	<p>
	Providing a constant presence throughout the whole Benefice is a Reader-in-Charge, licensed in October 2010, who takes many of the 
	non-sacramental services and plays a leading role in fostering a community spirit.
	</p>
	<p>
	With no other churches within the Benefice, we aim to cater for a wide range of Christians: Catholics, Methodists and Baptists alike.
	Our mainstay service is a traditional sung holy communion and a popular Family service with active participation by the children. 
	A monthly Matins service attracts a strong following from beyond the Benefice.  All six congregations come together on the third 
	Sunday of the month for a joint holy communion service.    Major festivals are well attended e.g. at Christmas 400 people will attend across four services.
	</p>
	<p>
	Visitors often comment on the simplicity and warmth of our worship.
	</p>
	<p>
	There is a lively Church of England primary school of about 50 pupils at Lovington and there are child play groups and a nursery within the area.
	Three village halls and three well-equipped playing fields provide ample opportunities for a wide range of social and leisure activities which bind
	the peoples of the Six Pilgrims ever closer together.
