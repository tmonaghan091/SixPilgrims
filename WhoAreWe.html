<h1> Who Are We?</h1>
	<p> 
	This corner of Somerset is very rural; the working backbone is still farming interspersed with a variety of small enterprise businesses, 
	plus a major employer in Westland Helicopters at nearby Yeovil and a military presence at the Royal Naval Air Station at Yeovilton.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Nestling east of the busy A37, Fosse Way, and the A303, you will find the Somerset countryside at its best.  Small fields, 
	grazing cattle and sheep, wild flower meadows and a botanically rich SSI nature reserve.  The whole overlooked to the south 
	by Cadbury Hill (thought to be possibly the site of where King Arthur set his Camelot) and to the north by the legendary
	Glastonbury Tor (reputedly the Isle of Avalon, final resting place of Arthur).  Stonehenge, the Jurassic Coast and Exmoor 
	are within easy reach.
	</p>
	<p>
	Scattered among the Six we have two village pubs, an ice cream factory and an artisan bakery. But, alas, no shop!
	</p>
	<p> 
	Social life could not be more active.  Each of the six parishes has its own pattern of village events:
	<p>
	Sports days, Bonfire Night, wassailing, boules competitions, sponsored walks, road races. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Coffee mornings, a lunch club, folk music concerts, a film society, harvest suppers, fetes and bazaars.
	</p>
	<p>
	Quiz nights, auctions of promises, antiques evenings, flower festivals.
	</p>
	<p>
	So many ways in which we strengthen our community spirit and raise the funds to keep the Six financially viable.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Christian calendar provides more opportunities for interactivity. Palm Sunday parades with donkeys,
	Good Friday processions behind a large cross, beating of the bounds on Rogation Sunday as well as children
	being encouraged to create their own Christingle symbols and to bring their pets to an open-air service in 
	the churchyard.  Music is a popular element with the Six Pilgrims choir touring the Benefice and children 
	forming their own impromptu band, the Babcary Big Noise, which performs at our Family Services.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Life is rarely dull in this secluded corner of Somerset.
