			<h3>What is Our Vision?</h3>
			<p>
			Closer Together, Closer to God is the vision at the heart of why the Six Pilgrims group of churches 
			exists and flourishes.  We are joined together for we are stronger together. 
			Apart, our limited resources would leave us impoverished.  
			Together in God, we have developed a strong sense of community over nearly half-a-century

			<h3> Who Are We?</h3>
			<p>
			We live in a land of quiet for the birdsong, dark for the stars and safe enough to leave your door unlocked. 
			A place where people stop to talk to neighbours and strangers alike.  
			In all, we number 702 souls of all shapes and sizes, ages, backgrounds, beliefs. All our six churches stand on ancient
			foundations and are beautifully maintained

			<h3> Who Are You?</h3>
			<p>
			Without a resident minister for three years, the Six Pilgrims has evolved a highly efficient
			working practice with the Reader-in-Charge, the joint churchwardens committee and the respective 
			PCCs all combining to take total responsibility for administration and fund-raising.  
			What we now seek is an inspirational presence to widen our vision

		<h3> Where You Will Live</h3>
		<p>
			Jessamine Cottage is a sturdy stone-built, three-bedroomed cottage, recently modernised to a high standard. 
			Situated only 200 yards from one of our churches, it has an attractively secluded  garden laid out with shrubs, 
			flower beds and a vegetable patch.  The cottage stands back from a quiet country road and has its own parking 
			space for two cars.
